# ClawdDesk — Backlog: DONE

> Reconciled 2026-06-16 against the git history, the code, and the change log in `backlog.md`.
> Everything below is **shipped and verified** (merged to `main`, covered by the test suite where applicable).
> Companion file: [`backlog-open.md`](./backlog-open.md) — what's still open, in priority order.
>

| F6 | Per-agent model selector | Opus / Sonnet / Haiku; runtime override via `/api/model/:agentId` |
| F7 | Model + auth footer on each reply | Captured from `system.init`; "Max plan" when OAuth |
